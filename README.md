Make sure that the .py files are in the same file. 
If you do not provide this, you can see the answer of the code in the console section, but you cannot obtain the files of the sensitivity analysis. 
For most accurate results, create a file first. 
Then copy the file path. 
Paste the file path you copied after the 'r' statement in the code. 
Don't forget to delete the old file path while doing this. 
Never delete extensions such as 'SA_Report.txt', mdl_labels.lp', mdl_nolabels.lp', ReducedCosts.xlsx. 
Actually, what you need to do is to write your own file path where it says /Users/emrebasaran/Desktop/. 

Another important point is that the libraries used in this file and the pyomo package must be installed in the IDE you use.

Good luck..
