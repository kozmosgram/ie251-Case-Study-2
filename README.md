Introduction of the Project

IE-Tech manufactures high-quality components for robotics enthusiasts and pre-assembled robotic kits. Its product line includes aluminum frames, carbon fiber frames, manual modules, advanced control modules, and advanced sensor modules. These components are produced across three plants located in Istanbul, Ankara, and Izmir. Each has distinct production processes, resource availabilities, and capacities. Additionally, the company assembles robotic kits that integrate these components. IE-Tech must balance resource limitations, production costs, and fluctuating customer
demands while maximizing profitability. The production and sales plan for a two-month horizon must be optimized.

This study provides a thorough review of Pyomo's solution to IE-Tech's production and sales optimization problem. Charts and graphs are used to assist the data-driven findings, sensitivity analysis, and graphical insights that address resource allocation, demand fulfillment, and resource allocation suggestions. The report also includes cost-benefit analyses of additional investments and strategies for managing increasing costs.


IMPORTANT POINTS:

Make sure that the .py files are in the same file. 
If you do not provide this, you can see the answer of the code in the console section, but you cannot obtain the files of the sensitivity analysis. 
For most accurate results, create a file first. 
Then copy the file path. 
Paste the file path you copied after the 'r' statement in the code. 
Don't forget to delete the old file path while doing this. 
Never delete extensions such as 'SA_Report.txt', mdl_labels.lp', mdl_nolabels.lp', ReducedCosts.xlsx. 
Actually, what you need to do is to write your own file path where it says /Users/emrebasaran/Desktop/. 

Another important point is that the libraries used in this file and the pyomo package must be installed in the IDE you use.

Good luck..
